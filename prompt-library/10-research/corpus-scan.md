# Research Corpus Scan

Gemini large-context lane for expanding options over a big redacted corpus.
Advisory only.

## Prompt Contract

Send the redacted question and the corpus or scope. Ask for:

- candidate findings, patterns, and options across the corpus
- contradictions and outliers worth a closer look
- a separated list of claims to verify with a primary source

Rules:

- Redacted context only; no secrets, customer data, or private repository details.
- Every finding is a hypothesis until verified through Context7, official docs,
  local files, or tests.
- Do not present scanned text as authoritative fact.

## Eval Results

2026-06-20 manual fixture eval against
`prompt-library/05-evaluation/research-lane-cases.md`: pass for redacted corpus
expansion, candidate pattern discovery, contradiction/outlier surfacing,
claims-to-verify separation, and no source-of-truth claims. The prompt remains
`candidate`.
