# Gemini Brainstorming

Use Gemini as advisory support for divergent thinking. Provide redacted context,
ask for multiple distinct options, and label all outputs as ideas until local
files, tests, Context7, or official docs verify them.

Use `02-gemini/input-packet-template.md` for the actual packet shape. Do not
send a full workspace dump or raw agent output. If the task is RadeQ design work,
use `02-gemini/radeq-design-brainstorming.md` so Gemini receives the product
brief instead of Autopilot governance context.
