# Output Validation Rule

Prompts must define the expected output before use. For structured outputs,
prefer schemas or deterministic validators when available.

## Prompt Contract

Declare the requested output format, required sections, forbidden sections, and
failure behavior. For high-risk work, require an eval case before changing a
default prompt.

## Acceptance Checks

- Output format is explicit.
- Failure or uncertainty behavior is explicit.
- Required evidence is present.
- The prompt has at least one eval fixture or checklist entry.
