# Copywriting Localization

Qwen local lane for translation drafts. Runs fully local for private or bulk
content. Drafts only; the Localization Reviewer gate stays with the owner or
Opus.

## Prompt Contract

Given source copy, target locales, and a terminology glossary, produce:

- translation drafts per locale
- terminology kept consistent with the glossary
- accessibility-language notes (reading level, idioms to avoid)
- a list of segments that need human or Opus review

Rules:

- Stay local; do not send private content to a free-cloud model.
- Do not invent claims or change meaning during translation.
- Mark drafts as needing review; localization quality is approved by the owner or
  the Localization Reviewer, not by this lane.

## Eval Results

2026-06-20 manual fixture eval against
`prompt-library/05-evaluation/copywriting-lane-cases.md`: pass for local-only
private handling, terminology consistency, meaning preservation,
accessibility-language notes, and review-required marking. The prompt remains
`candidate`.
