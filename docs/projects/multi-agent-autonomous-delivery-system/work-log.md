# Multi-Agent Autonomous Delivery System Work Log

## 2026-05-24 Mesh Audit Implementation

Date: 2026-05-24
Request or trigger: user requested implementation of the workflow and mesh audit after research-first review.
Mode: WRITE_ALLOWED for local governance, mesh, MCP, docs, tests, dashboard, and dependency hygiene.
Scope: strengthen the existing read-only context-router path without creating a parallel system.
Files changed:

- `mcp/server.ts`
- `src/lib/decision-mesh/*.ts`
- `src/data/delivery-system/capabilities.ts`
- `src/data/delivery-system/workflows.ts`
- `src/pages/autopilot.astro`
- `tests/decision-mesh/query.test.ts`
- `tests/delivery-system/*.test.ts`
- `tests/autopilot-delivery-system.spec.ts`
- `docs/autopilot/decision-mesh-mcp-decision.md`
- `docs/autopilot/v3-prompt-pack.md`
- `docs/projects/multi-agent-autonomous-delivery-system/architecture.md`
- `docs/projects/multi-agent-autonomous-delivery-system/work-log.md`
- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`

Architecture impact: delivery-system context routing now includes project-specific mesh packets and an explicit memory-to-planning feedback loop. This remains a read-only governance and context layer, not an execution runtime.
Decisions:

- Use `build_project_mesh_packet` for project-owned context.
- Keep root Autopilot mesh and product/project meshes separate.
- Treat capability YAML as canonical content and TypeScript routing as an executable mirror.
- Keep parallel-system work deferred behind a future architecture decision.

Verification:

- Test-first audit checks passed after implementation.
- `npm run verify` passed with 12 Vitest files, 40 tests, Astro build, and 3 Playwright checks.
- MCP smoke test verified `build_project_mesh_packet` against the Radeq project mesh.
- Package hygiene checks passed: no vulnerabilities, no outdated packages, and no extraneous top-level packages.

Risks:

- Future project work must keep project meshes updated after completed slices.
- More drift checks may be needed as capability routing grows.

Project mesh impact: no semantic change to this project's project-specific mesh in this slice; the MCP/query layer now supports project mesh packets.

## 2026-05-24 Capability Routing And Context Economy

Date: 2026-05-24
Request or trigger: user requested cautious implementation of capability routing and reasoning/model-spend improvements without closing the door to a future parallel system.
Mode: WRITE_ALLOWED for local governance, mesh, MCP, docs, and tests.
Scope: extend the existing Autopilot Decision Mesh and typed governance contracts with capability routing, context economy, provider-neutral model spend policy, and project-specific mesh seed.
Files changed:

- `mesh/`
- `mcp/server.ts`
- `src/data/delivery-system/capabilities.ts`
- `src/data/delivery-system/contextEconomy.ts`
- `src/data/delivery-system/modelSpend.ts`
- `src/lib/decision-mesh/*.ts`
- `tests/delivery-system/*.test.ts`
- `tests/decision-mesh/query.test.ts`
- `docs/projects/multi-agent-autonomous-delivery-system/decision-mesh/`
- `docs/projects/multi-agent-autonomous-delivery-system/architecture.md`
- `docs/projects/multi-agent-autonomous-delivery-system/work-log.md`

Architecture impact: the delivery-system context router now selects capability modules before planning and records context economy/model spend policy as typed data. A project-specific Decision Mesh seed now exists for this subsystem.
Decisions:

- Add `select_capabilities` to the existing read-only MCP server.
- Keep the system local-first and provider-neutral.
- Keep frontier reasoning as strategic escalation, not everyday work.
- Keep the future parallel system option behind architecture decision.

Verification:

- Targeted typed policy tests passed.
- Targeted Decision Mesh query tests passed after `selectCapabilities` was added.
- Project mesh policy test passed after this project's mesh seed was created.
- MCP smoke test called `select_capabilities` and returned a compact capability packet for a slow-site SEO task.
- `npm run verify` passed: mesh check, typecheck, 9 Vitest files with 35 tests, Astro build, and 3 Playwright tests.
- `npm audit` reported 0 vulnerabilities.
- `git diff --check` passed with only existing LF/CRLF normalization warnings.

Risks:

- Execution runtime remains deferred.
- The project mesh is a seed and should grow with future work slices.

Project mesh impact: `docs/projects/multi-agent-autonomous-delivery-system/decision-mesh/` was created with governance pipeline, worker boundary, and model routing boundary nodes.

## 2026-05-24 Decision Mesh Context Router

Date: 2026-05-24
Request or trigger: user requested a Decision Mesh MVP after research-first validation, with Codex consuming relevant subgraphs through MCP and 3D visualization deferred.
Mode: WRITE_ALLOWED for local read-only context-router implementation.
Scope: add YAML/JSON Decision Mesh, pure query layer, local read-only MCP tools, generated graph artifact, AGENTS/GEMINI instructions, and tests.
Files changed:

- `mesh/`
- `src/lib/decision-mesh/*.ts`
- `mcp/server.ts`
- `scripts/generate-decision-mesh.ts`
- `tests/decision-mesh/*.test.ts`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `GEMINI.md`
- `docs/autopilot/decision-mesh-mcp-decision.md`
- `docs/projects/multi-agent-autonomous-delivery-system/architecture.md`
- `docs/projects/multi-agent-autonomous-delivery-system/work-log.md`

Architecture impact: the delivery system advanced from read-only command center to read-only Decision Mesh context router. Execution runtime, remote MCP transport, connector mutation, and 3D viewer remain deferred.
Decisions:

- Codex should consume compact mesh context through MCP tools instead of reading the full graph by default.
- YAML is the mesh source of truth; generated JSON is a derived artifact.
- Stop conditions from the mesh require owner decision unless the task is explicitly to resolve them.
- Frontier reasoning is a strategic escalation layer only; routine worker tasks stay local by default.
- Autopilot's root mesh is operational only; every supervised project must create and maintain its own project-specific mesh.
- Viewer work is deferred until query/MCP behavior is stable.

Verification:

- Targeted Decision Mesh tests passed.
- Generated JSON sync check passed.
- Typecheck passed.
- MCP smoke test called `get_relevant_subgraph` over stdio through the SDK client and returned the expected avatar-upload context.
- Reasoning policy tests verify local-worker default and strategic frontier escalation rules.
- Project mesh policy tests verify project mesh onboarding and update requirements.
- Full `npm run verify` passed.
- `npm audit` reported 0 vulnerabilities after lockfile remediation.

Risks:

- MCP client registration is not automated in this repository.
- Future mesh growth will need stronger schema validation and possibly SQLite or Neo4j indexing.

## 2026-05-13 Planning Baseline

Date: 2026-05-13
Request or trigger: user requested a complete multi-agent autonomous delivery system plan using plugins and skills.
Mode: WRITE_ALLOWED for documentation and planning only.
Scope: create design spec, implementation plan, project architecture record, work log, registry row, and Autopilot run-log evidence.
Files changed:

- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-13-multi-agent-autonomous-delivery-system-design.md`
- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-13-multi-agent-autonomous-delivery-system.md`
- `docs/projects/multi-agent-autonomous-delivery-system/architecture.md`
- `docs/projects/multi-agent-autonomous-delivery-system/work-log.md`
- `docs/autopilot/project-architecture-registry.md`
- `docs/autopilot/2026-05-10-autopilot-run-log.md`

Architecture impact: created a new planned project architecture for the governed multi-agent autonomous delivery system.
Decisions:

- The system starts as governance, ledgers, architecture records, and read-only contracts.
- Execution engines are deferred until after a decision record compares Vercel, Cloudflare, GitHub Actions, Codex automations, and local queue options.
- Autopilot is monitoring and recovery, not the main orchestrator and not the product owner.
- Qwen worker usage is optional and bounded; it is not a governance or architecture authority.

Verification:

- `rg -n "Multi-Agent Autonomous Delivery System|multi-agent-autonomous-delivery-system|decision_id|issue_id|gate_result|Autopilot Supervisor|Nobody approves" ...`: found the new registry row, design spec, implementation plan, project architecture, work log, and run-log entry.
- Placeholder-token scan over the new multi-agent delivery docs: no matches.
- `git diff --check`: passed with existing LF-to-CRLF warnings only.

Risks:

- No runtime implementation exists yet.
- Connector-backed inventory is not normalized yet.
- External facts about workflow runtimes and model availability must be rechecked before implementation.

Follow-up:

- Execute Task 2 from the implementation plan to create detailed governance and ledger docs.
- Create typed contracts only after governance docs are accepted.

## 2026-05-13 Strict Repository Separation

Date: 2026-05-13
Request or trigger: user clarified that Autopilot is its own project and creates other projects, each with separate directories and repositories.
Mode: WRITE_ALLOWED for documentation only.
Scope: update the delivery-system design and plan so the system enforces repository separation before execution.
Files changed:

- `docs/projects/multi-agent-autonomous-delivery-system/architecture.md`
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-13-multi-agent-autonomous-delivery-system-design.md`
- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-13-multi-agent-autonomous-delivery-system.md`
- `docs/autopilot/project-architecture-registry.md`
- `docs/autopilot/repository-separation-policy.md`

Architecture impact: the multi-agent delivery system is now scoped as an Autopilot subsystem that creates or supervises separate product repositories, not a shared product repository.
Decisions:

- Delivery-system implementation belongs in `SirRadek/autopilot`.
- Product projects created by the delivery system must live under `C:\Users\sirok\Documents\Projects\<project-slug>` and `SirRadek/<project-slug>`.
- Repository boundary checks are part of governance.

Verification:

- Repository-boundary search confirmed the delivery system is documented as an Autopilot subsystem that creates or supervises separate product repositories.
- Placeholder-token scan returned no matches.
- `git diff --check` passed with only LF/CRLF normalization warnings for existing files `docs/autopilot/2026-05-10-autopilot-run-log.md` and `docs/autopilot/v3-prompt-pack.md`.

Risks:

- Physical repository split is not done yet.

Follow-up:

- Implement repository-boundary checks in typed contracts after governance docs are accepted.

## 2026-05-13 Phase 0 Workflow Governance

Date: 2026-05-13
Request or trigger: user asked to proceed with the workflow modification after the Autopilot/Radeq repository split.
Mode: WRITE_ALLOWED for Autopilot control-plane documentation.
Scope: create the phase-0 delivery-system workflow, governance, ledger, and model-policy contracts without adding runtime code.
Files changed:

- `docs/autopilot/delivery-system-governance.md`
- `docs/autopilot/delivery-system-ledgers.md`
- `docs/autopilot/delivery-system-model-policy.md`
- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-13-multi-agent-autonomous-delivery-system.md`
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-13-multi-agent-autonomous-delivery-system-design.md`
- `docs/projects/multi-agent-autonomous-delivery-system/architecture.md`
- `docs/autopilot/project-architecture-registry.md`
- `docs/autopilot/v3-prompt-pack.md`
- `docs/projects/multi-agent-autonomous-delivery-system/work-log.md`
- `docs/autopilot/2026-05-10-autopilot-run-log.md`

Architecture impact: the delivery system is now defined as a phase-0 governance workflow with explicit layers, gates, ledgers, rework flows, model boundaries, and no runtime execution.
Decisions:

- Keep the post-split Autopilot repository docs-first for this workflow phase.
- Defer typed contracts, tests, and UI until an Autopilot runtime/package decision exists.
- Add ledger-impact checks to the prompt-pack gate model.
- Treat Qwen2.5-Coder 7B/14B as optional bounded worker candidates only, not governance or architecture authorities.

Verification:

- Required-term search found `Nobody approves their own work`, `decision_id`, `issue_id`, `gate_result`, `Qwen2.5`, `Autopilot monitors`, and ledger-impact gate language across the governance docs, plan, spec, architecture, and work logs.
- Placeholder-token scan returned no matches.
- Autopilot runtime-file scan returned no matches for `src`, `functions`, `migrations`, `public`, `tests`, `scripts`, `package.json`, or related runtime files.
- `git diff --check` passed with only LF/CRLF normalization warnings.

Risks:

- No typed registry or runtime enforcement exists yet.
- Connector snapshot procedure and execution-engine decision record now exist; they have not been exercised in a full dry run.

## 2026-05-13 Connector Snapshots And Execution Engine Deferral

Date: 2026-05-13
Request or trigger: user asked to continue the workflow modification after the phase-0 governance baseline.
Mode: WRITE_ALLOWED for Autopilot control-plane documentation.
Scope: complete the connector snapshot procedure, execution-engine options decision record, and prompt-pack integration without adding runtime code.
Files changed:

- `docs/autopilot/delivery-system-connector-snapshots.md`
- `docs/autopilot/delivery-system-execution-engine-options.md`
- `docs/autopilot/v3-prompt-pack.md`
- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-13-multi-agent-autonomous-delivery-system.md`
- `docs/projects/multi-agent-autonomous-delivery-system/architecture.md`
- `docs/autopilot/project-architecture-registry.md`
- `docs/projects/multi-agent-autonomous-delivery-system/work-log.md`
- `docs/projects/autopilot-control-plane/work-log.md`
- `docs/autopilot/2026-05-10-autopilot-run-log.md`

Architecture impact: the workflow now has a connector evidence snapshot procedure and a runtime decision record; execution remains deferred.
Decisions:

- Connector snapshots are reviewed evidence only, not a source of truth or approval.
- No durable execution runtime is selected in phase 0.
- Phase-5 trigger criteria are recorded before any workflow engine implementation can start.
- Prompt-pack rejection rules now block self-approval, unlogged issues, missing ledger impact, missing architecture impact, unverified plugin facts, and treating the architecture as permission for autonomous execution.

Verification:

- Required-term search found the multi-agent delivery architecture, ledger schemas, gate result, connector snapshot, execution-engine deferral decision, phase-5 trigger criteria, self-approval rejection, ledger impact, and architecture impact across `docs/`.
- Placeholder-token scan returned no matches.
- Autopilot runtime-file scan returned no matches for `src`, `functions`, `migrations`, `public`, `tests`, `scripts`, `package.json`, or related runtime files.
- `git diff --check` passed with only LF/CRLF normalization warnings.

Risks:

- No typed enforcement exists yet.
- Connector snapshots have not been exercised in a full dry run.
- Workflow runtime and model facts must be rechecked against current official docs before implementation.

## 2026-05-13 Typed Governance Contracts

Date: 2026-05-13
Request or trigger: user asked to execute the large workflow plan, use multiagent support, and proceed while checking work.
Mode: WRITE_ALLOWED for a minimal TypeScript/Vitest governance-contract package.
Scope: exercise read-only snapshot procedure, record runtime/package decision, add failing contract tests, implement typed registries and pure validators, and verify the non-execution boundary.
Files changed:

- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `vitest.config.ts`
- `src/data/delivery-system/roles.ts`
- `src/data/delivery-system/gates.ts`
- `src/data/delivery-system/workflows.ts`
- `src/data/delivery-system/ledgers.ts`
- `src/data/delivery-system/modelPolicy.ts`

- `docs/autopilot/delivery-system-snapshots/2026-05-13-autopilot-read-only-dry-run.md`
- `docs/autopilot/delivery-system-connector-snapshots.md`
- `docs/autopilot/delivery-system-execution-engine-options.md`
- `docs/autopilot/v3-prompt-pack.md`

- `docs/projects/autopilot-control-plane/work-log.md`
- `docs/autopilot/2026-05-10-autopilot-run-log.md`
- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-13-multi-agent-autonomous-delivery-system.md`

Architecture impact: the project advanced from phase-0 Markdown governance to phase-1 typed governance contracts. Execution runtime, connector clients, UI, deployments, and remote mutation remain out of scope.
Decisions:

- Minimal TypeScript/Vitest package is approved only for typed governance contracts and pure validators.
- Runtime dependencies remain empty.
- Development dependencies are limited to TypeScript, Vitest, and Node types.
- Markdown remains the human-readable source of policy; TypeScript mirrors it for executable validation.
- Source files must not import connector SDKs, network APIs, process execution APIs, or product runtime code.

Verification:

- Connector snapshot dry run covered local repository and GitHub metadata in read-only mode.
- Gemini advisory was run with sanitized aliases and treated as advisory only.
- Two inspect-only subagents reviewed architecture impact and dependency/no-side-effect boundaries.
- Red TDD run failed because `src/lib/delivery-system/governance` and `src/lib/delivery-system/ledger` did not exist.
- `npm run test -- tests/delivery-system/governance.test.ts tests/delivery-system/ledger.test.ts tests/delivery-system/boundary.test.ts`: passed 3 files and 11 tests after review fixes.
- `npm run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm run verify`: passed.
- Forbidden source/package scan returned no matches for process, network, connector, and cloud SDK usage in `src` and `package.json`.
- Forbidden product-runtime path scan returned no matches for app runtime or deployment paths.
- Placeholder-token scan returned no matches.
- `git diff --check` passed with only LF/CRLF normalization warnings.

Risks:

- Typed contracts can drift from Markdown governance docs.
- Package scope can creep toward UI, connector clients, or execution runtime if future changes ignore the runtime-package decision.
- Only local and GitHub snapshot dry run coverage exists so far.

## 2026-05-13 Read-Only Command Center

Date: 2026-05-13
Request or trigger: continue executing the multi-agent delivery plan after typed contracts passed.
Mode: WRITE_ALLOWED for static read-only UI and browser smoke tests.
Scope: add `/autopilot` command center, Playwright smoke test, and UI architecture decision without connector calls or execution behavior.
Files changed:

- `astro.config.mjs`
- `playwright.config.ts`
- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`
- `src/env.d.ts`
- `src/pages/autopilot.astro`
- `tests/autopilot-delivery-system.spec.ts`
- `tests/delivery-system/boundary.test.ts`
- `docs/autopilot/delivery-system-read-only-ui-decision.md`
- `docs/autopilot/v3-prompt-pack.md`
- `docs/autopilot/project-architecture-registry.md`
- `docs/projects/multi-agent-autonomous-delivery-system/architecture.md`
- `docs/projects/autopilot-control-plane/architecture.md`
- `docs/projects/multi-agent-autonomous-delivery-system/work-log.md`
- `docs/projects/autopilot-control-plane/work-log.md`
- `docs/autopilot/2026-05-10-autopilot-run-log.md`
- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-13-multi-agent-autonomous-delivery-system.md`

Architecture impact: the project advanced to phase-2 static read-only reporting. `/autopilot` renders local typed governance contracts and evidence paths, but does not call connectors, mutate data, run workflows, or approve delivery.
Decisions:

- Astro is approved only for static local read-only reporting.
- Playwright is approved only for local smoke verification.
- No UI framework, connector SDK, server API route, deployment target, credentials, or execution runtime is approved.

Verification:

- Context7 checked current Astro and Playwright docs before setup.
- `npm run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm run test`: passed 3 files and 11 tests after review fixes.
- `npm run build`: built one static page at `/autopilot/index.html`.
- First `npm run test:e2e` failed because Chromium was not installed.
- `npx playwright install chromium`: completed.
- Second `npm run test:e2e`: passed 3 Chromium tests, including mobile and desktop horizontal-overflow checks.
- Final `npm run verify`: passed typecheck, Vitest, Astro build, and Playwright e2e.

Risks:

- UI must remain static and read-only.
- Browser tooling surfaced through Playwright; the separate Browser plugin tool did not surface through tool search in this session.
