# GPT Reasoning Analysis

Use for complex analysis where the model should reason internally and return a
decision-ready summary.

## Prompt Contract

Analyze the task from the stated goal, available evidence, constraints, and
risks. Keep internal reasoning private. Return facts, assumptions, conflicts,
risks, and a recommended next step. Use sources for unstable claims.
