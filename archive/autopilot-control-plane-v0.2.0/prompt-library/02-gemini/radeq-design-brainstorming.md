# Gemini RadeQ Design Brainstorming

Use this prompt when Gemini is asked to brainstorm RadeQ visual/design
directions. It is intentionally product-focused so Gemini does not drift into
reviewing the Autopilot workspace or governance process.

## Gemini-Safe Packet

```md
# Gemini Advisory Packet

## Role

You are an external design and UX critic for a public marketing website. You are
advisory only. Do not approve implementation.

## Task Boundary

Focus only on RadeQ public website design direction.

Do not review:

- Autopilot control-plane internals,
- Codex runtime status,
- local workspace structure,
- CI/process governance,
- repository cleanup,
- unrelated projects.

## Product

Project alias: RadeQ public website.

Primary goal: generate more professional, playful, conversion-focused, and
non-technical-user-friendly website directions.

Target users: non-technical founders, expert brands, SMEs, and teams that need a
clearer website, lead path, demo, or lightweight workflow.

Critical action: open the right demo or send a qualified request.

Design/SEO tradeoff: `balanced` for the main homepage, with `brand_led`
experiments allowed for demo/preview directions when the minimum SEO floor
stays intact.

## Current Baseline

Use this sanitized baseline, not the live site:

- accepted preview label: PR 2 / commit a649c4a,
- A: Guided Offer Map,
- B: Cat Concierge,
- C: Studio Proof,
- D: Demo Worlds.

Known decision: A/B/C/D must be structurally different. Palette-only variants
fail.

Known issue to improve: polish and originality can be stronger without losing
clarity for non-technical buyers.

## Design Themes To Cross

Possible axes:

- lightness / freedom / space,
- novelty / standing out,
- modern retro / pixel vibe,
- art / editorial / written craft,
- futurism / modeled 3D / animation,
- chill / calm / calculated minimalism / focus,
- dopamine / colorful.

Do not combine all axes at once. For each idea choose:

- one primary personality axis,
- one contrast axis,
- one proof/product axis.

## Constraints

Keep:

- first-screen offer understandable,
- primary CTA as normal HTML,
- demo links readable,
- essential service/proof text outside canvas and media,
- mobile layout safe,
- accessible controls,
- reduced-motion fallback,
- no paid tools or unknown-cost dependencies,
- no unverified asset licenses.

Avoid:

- generic SaaS hero,
- repeated equal card grids,
- fake dashboards,
- four variants sharing one shell,
- mascot as decoration only,
- motion that hides the offer,
- developer-only language.

## Required Output

Return exactly these sections:

1. `Task Understanding` - 3 bullets max.
2. `Idea Cards` - 4 to 6 cards. Each card must include:
   - name,
   - theme crossing,
   - first viewport composition,
   - proof strategy,
   - motion/mascot role,
   - SEO/accessibility/performance compromise,
   - why it is different from A/B/C/D,
   - main risk.
3. `Best Hybrid` - one recommended compromise.
4. `Reject` - what not to build.
5. `Verification Needed` - claims that require local files, official docs,
   Context7, tests, browser evidence, or source/license checks.

Do not include implementation code. Do not claim current framework/library facts
unless marked `verification_needed`.
```

## Supervisor Acceptance Rule

Accept only output that clearly responds to the RadeQ product packet. Reject and
record the failure if Gemini analyzes the workspace, Autopilot governance, or
process instead of the website.
