# Sources And Citations Rule

Use official provider docs for provider-specific prompting behavior. Use local
repo files and tests for Autopilot behavior. Use DAIR.AI and GitHub catalogs as
inspiration only.

## Prompt Contract

For every current technical claim, provide one of:

- official documentation source
- Context7 source when connected
- local file path and verification command
- controlled browser evidence
- explicit "not verified yet" label

Do not use leaked system prompts or prompt packs as authority.
