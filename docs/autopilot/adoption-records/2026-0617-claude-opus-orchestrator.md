# Adoption Record

## Decision ID

adopt-2026-0617-claude-opus-orchestrator

## Date

2026-06-17

## What Was Proposed

Adopt Claude Opus through the owner's subscription-interactive Claude Code path
as the preferred Autopilot supervisor and orchestrator for architecture review,
handoff design, bounded worker assignment, correction-loop review, and final
quality gating. Codex remains the bounded implementation worker for scoped local
changes. Gemini remains advisory for long-context brainstorming and critique
when its subscription CLI path is available and its output is locally verified.

## Decision: adopted

## Who Decided

SirRadek (owner)

## Reason

The supervisor architecture plan v2 and the POC handoff spike established a
workable split of responsibilities:

- Claude Opus is the high-trust supervisor for broad repository review,
  orchestration decisions, and cross-agent critique after owner-scoped access.
- Codex is the implementation worker for bounded tasks with allowed files,
  forbidden actions, local tests, and structured worker output.
- Gemini is not skipped silently; capacity or provider errors become visible
  alerts, blocked states, or explicit tier decisions.
- Worker and reviewer outputs are validated by local JSON schemas before reuse.
- The Decision Mesh now records subscription worker boundaries, reuse checks,
  skill registry policy, and supervisor execution-loop failure modes.

This keeps the system practical without turning advisory model output into a
source of truth or adding an autonomous execution queue.

## Tests Or Evidence

- `npm.cmd run verify` passed after the Core POC work before Wave 4.
- `node scripts/validate-spike-artifacts.mjs worker ...` and reviewer validation
  passed for the POC handoff spike artifacts.
- Live Codex worker spike produced a strict-AJV-valid worker output object for
  `hp-20260617-live-codex-spike`.
- Wave 4 Set A targeted tests passed for subscription budget, model policy,
  model output evaluation, token efficiency, tool inventory, and dependency
  freshness.
- Wave 4 Set B targeted tests passed for fallback chains and supervisor routing.
