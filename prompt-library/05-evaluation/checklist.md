# Prompt Evaluation Checklist

Before a prompt becomes a default:

- Metadata is complete.
- Model family is explicit.
- Sources are listed and current enough.
- The prompt does not depend on leaked system prompts.
- It includes uncertainty behavior.
- It includes output validation rules.
- It has at least one normal case and one failure case.
- It has been reviewed after any provider-model change.
- It has a rollback path through Git.
