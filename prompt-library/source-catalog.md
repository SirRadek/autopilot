patterns, asset scoring, taste memory, and QA before implementation.

Protective Supervision:

- `docs/autopilot/protective-supervision-operating-model.md`

- `docs/projects/radeq/work-log.md`
- `docs/projects/radeq/decision-mesh/`

Use for RadeQ-specific source-of-truth, route, SEO, lead-capture, deployment,
performance, and mascot boundaries.

Cat Mascot Provenance:

fallbacks, and private-reference boundaries.

## General Prompt Engineering Sources

DAIR.AI Prompt Engineering Guide:

- https://www.promptingguide.ai/

Use as a general learning reference and inspiration source for techniques,
RAG, agents, reasoning, factuality, and prompt hub examples. Do not treat it as
model-specific authority.

Awesome Prompt Engineering:

- https://github.com/promptslab/awesome-prompt-engineering

Use as a catalog for tools and eval ideas only. Check each candidate tool's
license, activity, pricing, and official documentation before adoption.

## Prompt Management References

Langfuse:

- Prompt management overview:
  https://langfuse.com/docs/prompt-management/overview
- Prompt version control:
  https://langfuse.com/docs/prompt-management/features/prompt-version-control

Braintrust:

- Prompt management article:

PromptHub:

- Prompt versioning:
  https://www.prompthub.us/features/prompt-versioning

Use these as future implementation references for versioning, labels, diffs,
rollback, and eval workflows. Do not add a paid or cloud dependency without an
owner decision.

## Rejected Sources

- Leaked system prompt repositories.
- Undated prompt packs with no eval evidence.
- Provider-specific prompts copied across models without testing.
- Social-media prompt recipes treated as source of truth.
- Model-generated prompt advice that is not verified against official docs,
  local files, tests, or controlled evidence.
