# Research Synthesis

Opus lane that turns research into a decision. Technology, library, and
best-practice claims pass the docs-verification lane: Context7 when connected,
official documentation otherwise.

## Prompt Contract

Given a research question and a source set, return:

- the answer with a source for every load-bearing claim
- a confidence level per claim and where evidence conflicts
- gaps that still need primary-source verification
- the decision the research supports and the open questions

Rules:

- Prefer official and primary sources; mark inspiration-only sources as such.
- Verify framework, library, SDK, API, SEO, and accessibility claims through
  Context7 or official docs before they enter a plan.
- Model output is never the source of truth.

## Eval Results

2026-06-20 manual fixture eval against
`prompt-library/05-evaluation/research-lane-cases.md`: pass for primary-source
preference, confidence labels, conflict handling, gaps, decision fit, and
blocking leaked or unknown-license sources. The prompt remains `candidate`.
