# Autopilot Run Log

Date: 2026-05-10
Mission: Radeq visual pro upgrade
Mission handoff: `docs/autopilot/2026-05-10-radeq-visual-pro-mission.md`
Supervisor mode: active monitoring

## Local Baseline

Commands run:

```text
npm run test
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

Results:

- `npm run test`: passed, 4 test files, 15 tests.
- `npm run typecheck`: passed, 0 errors, 0 warnings.
- `npm run build`: passed, 2 pages built.
- Build warning remains: some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification.

Browser baseline:

- Preview server started temporarily on `http://127.0.0.1:4321/` and stopped after screenshots.
- Screenshots saved in `docs/autopilot/radeq-baseline-2026-05-10/`.
- Routes checked: `/`, `/en/`.
- Viewports checked: 390x844, 768x1024, 1440x1100.
- Horizontal overflow: false for all checked route/viewport pairs.

Baseline artifacts:

- `docs/autopilot/radeq-baseline-2026-05-10/en-desktop.png`
- `docs/autopilot/radeq-baseline-2026-05-10/baseline-summary.txt`

Supervisor visual observation:

- First viewport is functional and responsive.
- The current look is still heavily terminal/cyber.
- Desktop has a large static-feeling opening area.
- Second section appears as a very large cropped heading at the fold.
- Mobile is readable, but the 3D/proof panel sits below fold and the hero does not yet deliver the desired professional visual impact.

## Bot Runs

### visual-direction-001

Role: Visual Direction Analyst
Mode: inspect-only
Status: completed and accepted
Files changed: none
Exact token usage: unavailable in current tools

Accepted findings:

- Use Process Academy as a motion/story reference, not a clone.
- Move toward a polished kinetic systems-lab feel.
- Add original Radeq assets and less generic bordered-card rhythm.
- Use scroll-led content beats with native scroll and reduced-motion fallback.
- Rework Style Matrix responsiveness.

### github-showcase-001

Role: GitHub Showcase Analyst
Mode: inspect-only
Status: completed and accepted
Files changed: none
Exact token usage: unavailable in current tools

Accepted findings:

- `archviz-workbench` is first showcase candidate.
- `radeq-website` is the showcase host.
- `autopilot-orchestration` stays private process evidence only.
- `archviz-workbench` PR #1 should be validated locally before becoming demo base.

### cat-motion-001

Role: 3D Cat Motion Analyst
Mode: inspect-only
Status: completed and accepted
Files changed: none
Exact token usage: unavailable in current tools

Accepted findings:

- Keep explicit opt-in and direct Three.js.
- Prefer a licensed/generated rigged GLB under strict budget.
- Keep cat contained first; cross-page movement requires safe-zone model.
- Implementation is blocked on asset source, movement scope, mobile policy, and personality level.

### gemini-visual-critic-001

Role: Gemini Critic
Mode: dry-run, redacted external advisory
Status: completed and accepted with verification notes
Files changed: none
Exact token usage: unavailable in current tools

Accepted findings:

- Add performance budget.
- Avoid scroll hijacking.
- Add i18n motion-layout checks.
- Add mobile WebGL and slow-network gates.
- Keep private GitHub inventory sanitized.

### radeq-site-audit-001

Role: Radeq Site Auditor
Mode: inspect-only
Status: completed and accepted with concerns
Files changed: none
Exact token usage: unavailable in current tools

Accepted findings:

- Routes `/` and `/en/` share the same section order and hydrate `StyleMatrixSimulator` and `ContactTerminal`.
- First viewport is readable and localized, but the visual system is still too dark terminal/grid/lime-cyan for the target professional systems-lab direction.
- Proof sections still need real case assets and project evidence.
- No horizontal overflow was observed at 390, 768, 1440, or 1920 widths.
- Tablet hero fallback needed clipping.
- `StyleMatrixSimulator` is too long on mobile/tablet and should become tabbed or segmented.
- Current motion is mostly decorative loops, not scroll-led meaning.
- Reduced-motion cat launch could leave a blank panel.
- `ContactTerminal` used `navigator.language` instead of active route locale for lead payload metadata.

Small direct fixes approved:

- Add route-locale lead payload metadata.
- Prevent reduced-motion 3D cat launch from leaving a blank panel.
- Clip `.core-panel` decorative fallback inside the panel.
- Add regression tests for all three fixes.

Larger bot-assigned work remains:

- Visual system and original assets.
- Style Matrix mobile redesign.
- Scroll-led motion pass.
- 3D cat asset/interactions.
- Archviz case-study evidence pack.
- QA/performance/accessibility review after each visual slice.

### small-fix-slice-001

Role: Supervisor direct implementation
Mode: scoped write allowed
Status: completed and verified
Files changed:

- `src/lib/leads.ts`
- `src/components/ContactTerminal.tsx`
- `src/components/CoreIsland.tsx`
- `src/data/siteContent.ts`
- `src/styles/global.css`
- `tests/terminal.test.ts`
- `tests/smoke.spec.ts`

Red tests before fix:

- `npm run test -- tests/terminal.test.ts`: failed as expected because `createLeadPayload` did not exist.
- `npm run test:e2e -- tests/smoke.spec.ts`: failed as expected on `.core-panel` overflow and reduced-motion cat fallback.

Implementation:

- Added `createLeadPayload(brief, context)` in `src/lib/leads.ts`.
- `ContactTerminal` now passes `locale` from the active route instead of `navigator.language`.
- `CoreIsland` now blocks WebGL launch when `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is active and shows localized fallback copy.
- `.core-panel` now uses `overflow: hidden`.
- Added localized reduced-motion labels in Czech and English.
- Added Vitest and Playwright regression coverage.

Targeted verification:

- `npm run test -- tests/terminal.test.ts`: passed, 8 tests.
- `npm run test:e2e -- tests/smoke.spec.ts`: passed, 3 tests.

Full verification after fix:

- `npm run test`: passed, 4 test files, 16 tests.
- `npm run typecheck`: passed, 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 hints.
- `npm run build`: passed, 2 pages built.
- `npm run test:e2e`: passed, 4 tests.
- Build warning remains: some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification.

Current-doc check:

- Context7 Playwright docs checked for `page.emulateMedia({ reducedMotion: 'reduce' })` and `expect(locator).toHaveCSS(...)`.

### gemini-small-fix-critic-001

Role: Gemini Critic
Mode: advisory-only, `gemini -m auto --skip-trust --approval-mode plan`
Status: completed with caveat
Files changed: none
Exact token usage: unavailable in current tools

Gemini output:

- Returned PASS for route locale metadata, reduced-motion cat fallback, and core panel clipping.
- Recommended final Playwright smoke verification.

Caveat:

- Gemini also emitted a warning that a `run_shell_command` tool was unavailable and briefly hit a model capacity retry. Therefore its output was treated only as advisory and was accepted only because local tests/typecheck/build independently passed.

### intake-research-protocol-001

Role: Supervisor prompt-pack update
Mode: scoped docs write allowed
Status: completed
Files changed:

- `docs/autopilot/v3-prompt-pack.md`
- `docs/autopilot/2026-05-10-radeq-visual-pro-mission.md`

Input:

- User clarified that the 3D cat does not need to spin.
- Desired behavior is head/eye tracking toward the mouse, petting response, realistic segmented or rigged movement, and static-web feasibility.
- User requested Autopilot to handle normal input, ask questions and priorities, run independent GPT and Gemini research, synthesize the best implementation, and continue from that synthesis.

Independent research:

- GPT-side researcher completed inspect-only analysis and recommended intake record, clarification rule, priority triage, GPT/Gemini research separation, fact verification table, synthesis gate, proceed gate, and a 3D cat brief.
- Gemini CLI ran with `gemini -m auto --skip-trust --approval-mode plan` as advisory only and recommended a similar intake/research/synthesis flow plus 3D mascot risk gates.
- Context7 Three.js docs were checked for current GLTF loading, `AnimationMixer`, render loop, and disposal patterns.

Accepted changes:

- Added Normal Request Intake And Research Protocol to the prompt pack.
- Added Intake Triage Bot, GPT Researcher, and 3D Mascot Specialist roles.
- Added intake, independent research, synthesis, and 3D mascot safety verification gates.
- Updated the Radeq mission with the new intake/research flow.
- Updated the cat brief so primary behavior is segmented or rigged anatomical motion, pointer/head/eye tracking, and petting response, not continuous rotation.

Verification performed:

- Incomplete-marker scan: no matches.
- Role-section scan confirmed Intake Triage Bot, GPT Researcher, and 3D Mascot Specialist exist in `v3-prompt-pack.md`.
- Consistency scan confirmed intake/research protocol and cat behavior update exist in prompt pack, mission handoff, and run log.
- App tests were not rerun because this slice changed Markdown operating docs only.

### private-cat-reference-001

Role: Reference Cat Intake Bot plus supervisor docs update
Mode: inspect-only bot, scoped docs/asset write by supervisor
Status: completed and monitoring
Files changed or created:

- `docs/autopilot/reference/private-cat-reference.jpeg`
- `public/reference/cat-reference.jpeg`
- `docs/autopilot/v3-prompt-pack.md`
- `docs/autopilot/2026-05-10-radeq-visual-pro-mission.md`
- `docs/autopilot/2026-05-10-autopilot-run-log.md`

Input:

- User provided a private local photo of their ginger cat and asked to use it as the reference.

Autopilot run:

- `Reference Cat Intake Bot` inspected the local image only.
- The bot returned a private-reference brief: friendly ginger/orange tabby, plush rounded body, large dark curious eyes, compact muzzle, upright triangular ears, subtle striping, long expressive tail, light whiskers, calm upward-looking personality, side-rub/lean behavior, blink, ear twitch, head tilt, paw adjustment, and tail sway.

Accepted rules:

- Original photo was copied as the local working reference asset.
- Superseded by later user approval: Gemini/public use is allowed, but only through `public/reference/cat-reference.jpeg`.
- Do not send the original local/iCloud path or unrelated metadata to Gemini or other external models.
- Do not use the original image as a texture, trace, or exact pet replica; the public derivative may be used as a reference asset.
- Do not include the bed sheet, sofa, room layout, camera angle, or private domestic setting.
- Future mascot should be an original stylized ginger tabby inspired by the reference.

Current status:

- Reference image copied to `docs/autopilot/reference/private-cat-reference.jpeg`.
- Public derivative created at `public/reference/cat-reference.jpeg`.
- User later approved using the cat reference with Gemini and public outputs.
- Mission handoff now embeds the private local reference image for future local bot work.
- Prompt pack now distinguishes the original working reference from the public/Gemini-approved derivative.

Gemini/public approval update:

- User explicitly approved Gemini and public use after the first private-only rule was written.
- A smaller public derivative was created at `public/reference/cat-reference.jpeg`.
- Gemini advisory ran against the public reference path plus a text description and returned PASS for the 3D mascot direction.
- Gemini did not explicitly confirm whether the image file was loaded through `@public/reference/cat-reference.jpeg`; treat its critique as advisory.
- Gemini's suggestion to add `three-stdlib/getGPUTier` is not accepted yet because a new dependency requires separate verification and need.

Prompt Scope Auditor:

- Status: completed with concerns.
- Accepted fixes: resolve the personal-photo rule conflict in `v3-prompt-pack.md` and the superseded private-only rule in this log.
- Both fixes were applied in this run.

## Current Decision

The autopilot handoff and first controlled run are active, not only planned. The prompt pack and mission docs are done, bots completed the first audit round, and the supervisor implemented only small validated fixes.

Do not start large visual implementation until intake, independent research, synthesis, and visual direction are approved.

Safe next implementation candidates:

1. Style Matrix mobile controls/density improvement.
2. First-viewport and fold-rhythm redesign.
3. Original visual asset inventory and concept pass.
4. Archviz evidence-pack audit and demo completion plan.
5. 3D cat asset source, rig/segment strategy, pointer tracking, and petting interaction design.

Blocked decisions:

- 3D cat asset source.
- Whether cat stays hero-only or can move cross-page.
- Whether a licensed rigged GLB is acceptable or the procedural cat should be improved first.
- Cat mobile policy and personality level.
- Whether to clone/validate `archviz-workbench` PR #1 locally.

## 3D Cat Mascot Implementation Run

### 3d-cat-mascot-implementation-001

Role: Supervisor, Asset License Auditor, Gemini Critic, local implementation worker
Mode: local implementation with controlled external advisory
Status: completed

Files changed or created:

- `src/lib/catMascot.ts`
- `src/components/CoreIsland.tsx`
- `src/components/HeroSection.astro`

- `docs/autopilot/cat-mascot-2026-05-10/mobile-final-canvas.png`

Input:

- User approved doing the full supervised 3D cat work with agents, plugins, skills, Context7, and Gemini.
- User asked for a less intensive static-site approach and asked whether an existing editable 3D model could be used and optimized.

Agent and advisory work:

- Asset License Auditor reviewed Pixabay, Quaternius, and Sketchfab options.
- Accepted auditor constraint: avoid Pixabay as a raw public site asset unless direct CC0 provenance is verified; avoid Sketchfab CC BY as the first MVP choice.
- Context7 checked current Three.js `GLTFLoader`, `AnimationMixer`, disposal guidance, and glTF Transform CLI guidance.
- Gemini CLI ran with `gemini -m auto --skip-trust --approval-mode plan` in advisory mode only.
- Accepted Gemini recommendation: choose the full-body Quaternius candidate because it has head, tail, legs, and headbutt/idle animation support.
- Rejected Gemini recommendations to add `react-three-fiber`, `@react-three/drei`, `gltfjsx`, or Draco compression for this MVP.

Implementation:

- Replaced the procedural spinning cat with a lazy-loaded Quaternius GLB.
- Kept Three.js, GLTFLoader, and the GLB behind the user's 3D launch button.
- Added ginger/brown material tuning inspired by the approved cat reference.
- Added `Idle` animation, head/body/tail pointer tracking, and a `Headbutt` petting response.
- Added reduced-motion no-canvas behavior.
- Added viewport/background-tab pause via `IntersectionObserver` and `visibilitychange`.
- Switched the hero island to `client:load` so the first-viewport launch button is hydrated before a quick first click, while the expensive 3D payload remains click-lazy.
- Added model source/license/state data attributes for verification.

Verification:

- `npm run test`: passed, 20 tests.
- `npm run typecheck`: passed, 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 hints.
- `npm run build`: passed. Vite still warns about large chunks; Three.js remains dynamically imported after user launch.
- `npm run test:e2e`: passed, 5 tests.
- Canvas pixel gate via Playwright canvas screenshots and `sharp`:
  - desktop final canvas: 148,143 non-transparent pixels, 142,936 colored pixels, no page errors.
  - mobile final canvas: 113,564 non-transparent pixels, 52,881 colored pixels, no page errors.

Token and usage accounting:

- Codex subagent, Context7, and Gemini CLI responses did not expose token totals in tool output.
- No token numbers were invented.
- Practical optimization evidence recorded instead: accepted/rejected advisory items, command results, asset sizes, and verification artefacts.

Remaining follow-up:

- Current model is stylized low-poly, not realistic fur.
- Eye tracking is head/body/tail based because the selected rig does not expose separate eye bones.
- Cross-page roaming/scroll-follow behavior is not implemented; current scope stays inside the hero core panel to avoid overlap.

## Project Proof Workstream

### project-proof-intake-001

Role: Supervisor, GitHub Project Showcase Auditor, Radeq Site Integration Researcher, Security and Privacy Reviewer, Gemini Critic
Mode: inspect-only research plus scoped local content implementation
Status: completed and verified

User request:

- Start supervised website project work.
- Use GitHub, Superpowers, Linear, Codex Security, Gemini, Context7, and Autopilot supervision where available.
- Prefer provider-flexible worker prompts and avoid a hard Qwen dependency.

Availability checked:

- GitHub connector and `gh` CLI were usable for read-only repository context.
- Gemini CLI was available at version `0.41.2`; it ran with `gemini -m auto --skip-trust --approval-mode plan`.
- Context7 was usable for current Astro and Cloudflare documentation checks.
- Linear plugin skill was present, but no callable Linear MCP tools surfaced in this session.
- Local workspace is still not a Git repository.

Accepted research:

- Site integration researcher recommended the smallest safe public proof slice: keep the existing `DemoBlocks` section and convert the first 1-2 cards into sanitized proof/case-study archetypes.
- Project showcase auditor recommended proof priority:
  1. SEO before/after demo first because it is the cleanest public-safe proof block.
  2. Specialist workflow/architecture prototype second, but only as a sanitized archetype until private details are approved.
  3. Secure webhook gateway later with careful payload and secret sanitization.
  4. Deterministic scraping pipeline later with safe/local-only framing.
- Security reviewer found one medium privacy issue outside this content slice: lead capture stores full page path/referrer context in D1. This remains a follow-up.
- Gemini advisory agreed the existing demo/proof section is the right first slice and recommended abstract archetypes plus a negative disclosure check.

Implementation:

- Updated the first two `demos` cards in Czech and English to public-safe proof archetypes:
  - SEO repair: before/after.
  - Specialist workflow prototype.
- Kept private repository names, owner names, local audit paths, and client details out of public copy.
- Did not change layout components, backend code, lead capture behavior, routes, or remote services.

Files changed:

- `src/data/siteContent.ts`
- `tests/i18n-content.test.ts`
- `docs/autopilot/2026-05-10-autopilot-run-log.md`

TDD evidence:

- Added `tests/i18n-content.test.ts` assertions for the two proof cards and private identifier exclusion.
- Red run: `npm run test -- tests/i18n-content.test.ts` failed because the first two demo metrics were still empty.
- Green run after content update: `npm run test -- tests/i18n-content.test.ts` passed, 4 tests.

Final verification:

- `npm run test`: passed, 5 test files, 28 tests.
- `npm run typecheck`: passed, 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 hints.
- `npm run build`: passed, 2 pages built.
- Build warning remains: some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification.
- `npm run test:e2e`: passed, 5 Playwright tests.
- Built-output disclosure scan: passed. No forbidden private identifiers found in `dist`.

Follow-up:

- Fix privacy minimization in the lead payload path/referrer flow before expanding lead capture or analytics.
- Add visual screenshots for the proof cards if the next slice changes layout or density.
- Validate and screenshot the SEO demo repo before making stronger public outcome claims.

## Radeq Autopilot Health Run

### radeq-autopilot-health-2026-05-12

Role: Supervisor, GitHub repo auditor, docs verifier, frontend QA, security/privacy reviewer, Gemini Critic
Mode: inspect-only baseline, then scoped local privacy hardening
Status: completed and verified

User request:

- Run autopilot on `SirRadek/radeq`.
- Use available plugins and skills where applicable, including GitHub, Superpowers, Vercel, Linear, Cloudflare, Codex Security, Expo, Build Web Apps, Hostinger, Docket, Gemini, Context7, and Caveman.
- Continue to the next project after the Radeq pass.

Availability checked:

- GitHub connector and `gh` CLI were usable for read-only repository context.
- Gemini CLI was available at version `0.41.2` and ran in advisory-only plan mode.
- Context7 was usable for current Astro and Cloudflare Workers/Pages documentation checks.
- Build Web Apps frontend testing skill and Browser plugin were available. Browser DOM/log inspection worked; Browser screenshot capture timed out, so Playwright screenshot CLI was used for screenshot evidence.
- Cloudflare skill was applicable because the repo has Pages Functions and D1 binding docs.
- Codex Security full scan was not run because the request did not ask for a full security scan; a targeted secret/private-disclosure scan was run instead.
- Vercel Workflow skill was loaded for future durable workflow guidance, but no Vercel Workflow code was added.
- Linear skill was present, but no callable Linear tools surfaced in this session.
- Expo, Hostinger, and Docket had no applicable repo surface or callable task-specific tools for this Astro/Cloudflare project.

GitHub repository state:

- Repository: `SirRadek/radeq`
- Visibility: public
- Primary language: TypeScript
- Default branch: `new`
- Branches found through the GitHub connector: `new`, `v2`
- `gh pr list`: no pull requests.
- `gh issue list`: no issues.
- GitHub connector PR and issue searches also returned no items.

Context7 facts checked:

- Astro React islands still require explicit `client:*` hydration directives such as `client:load`, `client:idle`, and `client:visible`.
- Cloudflare Workers docs confirm D1 bindings are declared as bindings and TypeScript environments should model bindings explicitly.

Gemini advisory:

- Recommended the next workstream be resilience and performance hardening.
- Flagged hydration/performance risk around React islands and 3D assets.
- Flagged the missing real Cloudflare/D1 integration gate for lead capture.
- Recommended a "Lead Pipeline Integrity" acceptance test.
- Gemini output was advisory only; local tests and source inspection remained the source of truth.

Baseline verification:

- `npm run test`: passed, 7 test files, 40 tests.
- `npm run typecheck`: passed, 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 hints.
- `npm run build`: passed, 2 pages built. Vite large chunk warning remains.
- `npm run test:e2e`: passed, 5 Playwright tests.
- Browser DOM/log smoke on `http://127.0.0.1:4322/`: page title was `Radeq.cz | Rychlé weby a poptávkové systémy`; hero and cat launch content were present; console warning/error count was 0.
- Playwright screenshot evidence was captured in a temporary local file; the raw local path is intentionally omitted from the public log.

Security and privacy checks:

- High-confidence secret pattern scan found no committed GitHub/OpenAI/Google/Slack/private-key style secrets.
- Built-output disclosure scan found no forbidden private project identifiers in `dist`, `src`, `public`, or `functions`.
- Private original cat reference remains ignored by `.gitignore`; only `public/reference/cat-reference.jpeg` is tracked.

Next project selected:

- Lead metadata privacy hardening, because it was already listed as a follow-up and Gemini independently identified the lead pipeline as the next reliability gap.

Files changed:

- `src/lib/leads.ts`
- `tests/terminal.test.ts`
- `docs/autopilot/2026-05-10-autopilot-run-log.md`

TDD evidence:

- Red run: `npm run test -- tests/terminal.test.ts` failed because `source_path` still retained query strings and `referrer` still retained full paths.
- Implementation: `createLeadPayload` now stores route context without query/hash and stores same-origin referrers as path-only and external referrers as origin-only.
- Green run: `npm run test -- tests/terminal.test.ts` passed, 9 tests.

Final verification after privacy hardening:

- `npm run test`: passed, 7 test files, 41 tests.
- `npm run typecheck`: passed, 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 hints.
- `npm run build`: passed, 2 pages built. Vite large chunk warning remains.
- First `npm run test:e2e` rerun failed on 3D cat canvas because Playwright reused a stale manually started dev server that had logged a Vite full-reload `astro:server-app.js` error. No source fix was applied for this environmental failure.
- After stopping the stale dev server and letting Playwright start a fresh server, `npm run test:e2e` passed, 5 tests.
- Built-output disclosure scan after rebuild found no forbidden private identifiers.
- High-confidence secret pattern scan after changes found no GitHub/OpenAI/Google/Slack/private-key style secrets.

Remaining follow-up:

- Add `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` or Miniflare coverage if future changes need broader workerd edge-case testing beyond the local Wrangler happy-path D1 POST gate.
- Add performance budget checks for the 3D-heavy landing page.
- Add automated a11y checks for `ContactTerminal` and `StyleMatrixSimulator`.

## Cloudflare D1 Lead Pipeline Gate

### cloudflare-d1-lead-pipeline-gate-2026-05-12

Role: Supervisor, docs researcher, implementation worker, docs worker, security reviewer, Gemini critic
Mode: multiagent integration-gate implementation and verification
Status: completed and verified

User request:

- Build and verify a multiagent Cloudflare D1 lead-pipeline integration gate.
- Keep code, tests, documentation, and verification output scoped, sanitized, and explicit about what was personally run.

Multiagent roles:

- Docs researcher: checked the existing Cloudflare lead-capture doc, Wrangler setup notes, migration path, and current local test surface.
- Implementation worker: added a migration-backed local D1-style gate for the Pages Function insert path.
- Docs worker: recorded the gate and added local verification commands.
- Security reviewer: flagged direct API metadata trust, local D1 artifact hygiene, and documentation proof gaps.
- Gemini critic: recommended privacy assertions, official Workers runtime coverage, and clear separation between SQLite-backed and Wrangler-backed checks.
- Supervisor: implemented server-side normalization, ran Wrangler/D1 acceptance, and owns this final verification record.

Tools and external usage notes:

- GitHub usage: repository/issue/PR context may be inspected by the supervisor or implementation worker when needed, but this docs slice did not publish private repository details.
- Cloudflare usage: gate targets Cloudflare Pages Functions plus D1 binding `LEADS_DB`; account IDs, database IDs, API tokens, and local auth details must stay out of docs and prompts.
- Context7 usage: Cloudflare and framework documentation should be checked before binding, Wrangler, Pages Functions, D1, or test-runner decisions are finalized.
- Gemini usage: advisory-only critique is allowed with sanitized architecture and command summaries; do not send secrets, local auth output, raw lead data, or private repo metadata.

Gate acceptance criteria:

- Unit-level Pages Function coverage passes for valid D1 insert behavior and missing-binding failure handling.
- Local Cloudflare runtime check is run with Wrangler Pages dev against the built `dist` output.
- Local D1-backed POST to `/api/leads` returns a created lead response and stores one row with minimized context fields.
- Missing `LEADS_DB` path returns the documented setup error without leaking stack traces, account details, or secrets.
- Security reviewer confirms no secrets, private identifiers, raw local paths, or full external referrer paths are introduced in source, built output, logs, or docs.
- Gemini critic and supervisor review the gate output as advisory and final acceptance respectively.

Worker pre-check:

- `npm run test -- tests/api-leads.test.ts`: passed, 1 test file, 2 tests.

Supervisor verification:

- `npm run test:leads:cloudflare`: passed, 1 test file, 3 tests. The direct API cases verify server-side minimization before D1 insert.
- `npm run cf:d1:migrate:local`: passed. Wrangler 4.90.1 applied the local migration file with 4 successful commands.
- `npm run cf:pages:dev`: verified through the project script. Wrangler Pages dev served `dist` on `http://127.0.0.1:8788`, exposed local binding `env.LEADS_DB (radeq-leads)`, and returned `201 Created` for a fake-sensitive lead payload.
- Local D1 row inspection after the Wrangler POST returned `email=local-gate@example.com`, `source_path=/kontakt`, `referrer=https://ads.example`, `locale=en-US`, and `status=new`.
- The `cf:pages:dev` wrapper removed its temporary root `wrangler.toml` after the run.
- `npm run test`: passed, 8 test files, 44 tests.
- `npm run typecheck`: passed, 40 files, 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 hints.
- `npm run build`: passed, 2 pages built. Existing Vite large chunk warning remains.
- `npm run test:e2e`: passed, 5 Playwright tests.
- `node --check scripts/run-local-pages-dev.mjs`: passed.
- `git diff --check`: passed, with Git's existing LF-to-CRLF warnings only.
- High-confidence secret scan over relevant files found no GitHub/OpenAI/Google/Slack/private-key style secrets.
- Changed-file local path scan found no raw Windows local paths introduced by this gate.
- Runtime/build disclosure scan found no local gate sample data in `dist`, `src`, `public`, `functions`, `package.json`, or `scripts`.
- Context7 confirmed current Cloudflare Workers guidance for D1 bindings and the official `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` option; Wrangler CLI output established that Pages dev does not accept a custom config path.
- Gemini final critique was reviewed. Covered concerns: same-origin decisions are based on the request URL origin, relative `source_path` parsing uses a base URL, and the local SQL gate reads the exact migration file. Residual follow-ups are official Workers Vitest pool coverage, stricter external-referrer origin policy if needed, duplicate-submission handling, broader workerd edge-case tests, and frontend chunk budgeting.

Files changed by docs worker:

- `docs/autopilot/2026-05-10-autopilot-run-log.md`
- `docs/autopilot/free-lead-capture-cloudflare.md`

Current decision:

- Accepted for local happy-path Cloudflare Pages Function plus D1 lead routing, schema compatibility, and stored-field privacy minimization.
- This is not a remote Cloudflare deployment proof and does not replace a future official `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` or Miniflare edge-case suite.

## Project Architecture Governance

### project-architecture-governance-2026-05-13

Role: Supervisor and documentation worker
Mode: scoped documentation update
Status: completed and verified

User request:

- Every project must have its own written architecture.
- Architecture records must be regularly updated.
- Work must be logged so changes can drive future fixes, updates, and optimization.

Files created:

- `docs/autopilot/project-architecture-standard.md`
- `docs/autopilot/project-architecture-registry.md`
- `docs/projects/radeq/architecture.md`
- `docs/projects/radeq/work-log.md`
- `docs/projects/autopilot-control-plane/architecture.md`
- `docs/projects/autopilot-control-plane/work-log.md`

Files modified:

- `docs/autopilot/v3-prompt-pack.md`
- `docs/autopilot/2026-05-10-autopilot-run-log.md`

Architecture impact:

- Split project architecture evidence into per-project records under `docs/projects/`.
- Added a central registry for architecture records, work logs, review cadence, and current risks.
- Added an Autopilot gate requiring project architecture and work-log checks before implementation handoff.

Current decision:

- Radeq runtime and Autopilot control plane are tracked as separate projects.
- Active projects require weekly architecture review plus updates after every implementation slice.
- Work logs must state architecture impact, decisions, verification, risks, and follow-up.

Verification:

- `rg -n "Project Architecture|project architecture|Architecture impact|Project architecture checked|docs/projects|Next review" docs\autopilot docs\projects`: found the standard, registry, project records, prompt-pack gate, and work-log entries.
- `git diff --check`: passed with existing LF-to-CRLF warnings only.
- Placeholder-token scan over the new architecture docs and project records: no matches.

## Multi-Agent Autonomous Delivery System

### multi-agent-autonomous-delivery-system-plan-2026-05-13

Role: Supervisor, architecture planner, governance planner, plugin/skill router
Mode: scoped documentation and planning update
Status: completed and verified

User request:

- Plan a Multi-Agent Autonomous Delivery System with orchestration, business, execution, review/testing, governance, monitoring/autopilot, memory, context management, model policy, Gemini role, and operating principles.
- Use plugins and skills.

Skills and plugins used:

- Superpowers `brainstorming` and `writing-plans` guidance were loaded for structured design and implementation planning.
- GitHub skill guidance was loaded for repository and PR/issue/CI boundaries.
- Vercel Workflow skill guidance was loaded for future durable workflow research boundaries.
- Cloudflare platform skill guidance was loaded for future runtime comparison boundaries.
- Linear skill guidance was loaded for future issue/project workflow boundaries.
- Docket was treated as a future product knowledge source because callable Docket tools did not surface in this session.

Files created:

- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-13-multi-agent-autonomous-delivery-system-design.md`
- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-13-multi-agent-autonomous-delivery-system.md`
- `docs/projects/multi-agent-autonomous-delivery-system/architecture.md`
- `docs/projects/multi-agent-autonomous-delivery-system/work-log.md`

Files modified:

- `docs/autopilot/project-architecture-registry.md`
- `docs/autopilot/2026-05-10-autopilot-run-log.md`

Architecture impact:

- Added a new planned project for a governance-first multi-agent autonomous delivery platform.
- Kept execution runtime deferred until ledgers, gates, typed contracts, read-only UI, and execution-engine decision record exist.
- Defined Autopilot as monitoring and recovery, not product owner or governance approver.

Current decision:

- Proceed with Phase 0 and Phase 1 only after review: governance docs, ledgers, typed contracts, and tests.
- Do not add remote mutation, credentials, stored model providers, or durable execution until a later explicit approval.

Verification:

- `rg -n "Multi-Agent Autonomous Delivery System|multi-agent-autonomous-delivery-system|decision_id|issue_id|gate_result|Autopilot Supervisor|Nobody approves" ...`: found the new registry row, design spec, implementation plan, project architecture, work log, and run-log entry.
- Placeholder-token scan over the new multi-agent delivery docs: no matches.
- `git diff --check`: passed with existing LF-to-CRLF warnings only.

## Strict Repository Separation

### repository-separation-policy-2026-05-13

Role: Supervisor and architecture governance worker
Mode: scoped documentation update
Status: completed and verified

User request:

- Strictly separate Autopilot from other projects.
- Autopilot is its own project that creates and supervises other projects.
- Every project must have its own directory and repository.

Files created:

- `docs/autopilot/repository-separation-policy.md`

Files modified:

- `docs/autopilot/project-architecture-standard.md`
- `docs/autopilot/project-architecture-registry.md`
- `docs/autopilot/v3-prompt-pack.md`
- `docs/projects/autopilot-control-plane/architecture.md`
- `docs/projects/radeq/architecture.md`

- `docs/projects/multi-agent-autonomous-delivery-system/work-log.md`
- `docs/autopilot/2026-05-10-autopilot-run-log.md`

Architecture impact:

- Autopilot is now explicitly modeled as a standalone control-plane repository.
- Product projects must have separate local roots and separate remote repositories.
- Current Radeq/Autopilot co-location is documented as transitional and `split_required`.
- Repository boundary checks were added to the prompt-pack governance gates.

Current decision:

- Target Autopilot repository: `SirRadek/autopilot`.
- Radeq remains a product project at `SirRadek/radeq`.
- Autopilot may store governance metadata, ledgers, templates, and sanitized snapshots, not canonical product runtime code.

Verification:

- Repository-boundary search confirmed separation terms in the policy, registry, architecture records, work logs, plan, and spec.
- Placeholder-token scan returned no matches.
- `git diff --check` returned exit code 0 with only LF/CRLF normalization warnings for existing files `docs/autopilot/2026-05-10-autopilot-run-log.md` and `docs/autopilot/v3-prompt-pack.md`.

### physical-repository-split-2026-05-13

Role: Supervisor and repository migration worker
Mode: local filesystem split plus GitHub repository setup
Status: completed and verified

User request:

- Execute the strict split.
- Autopilot must be its own project and repository.
- Other projects must live in separate directories and repositories.

Actions:

- Created `C:\Users\sirok\Documents\Projects\radeq` as a clean local clone of `SirRadek/radeq`.
- Created GitHub repository `SirRadek/autopilot` as a private repository.
- Preserved the previous mixed checkout at `C:\Users\sirok\Documents\Autopilot-radeq-mixed-backup-20260513-160634`.
- Cleaned `C:\Users\sirok\Documents\Autopilot` so it contains Autopilot governance docs and no Radeq runtime source tree.
- Preserved the existing `C:\Users\sirok\Documents\Autopilot-v2` worktree by redirecting its git metadata to the mixed-checkout backup.
- Committed and pushed Radeq cleanup branch `codex/separate-autopilot-docs`.
- Opened Radeq cleanup PR `https://github.com/SirRadek/radeq/pull/1`.
- After explicit user approval, squash-merged Radeq cleanup PR `https://github.com/SirRadek/radeq/pull/1` into `new` as `ef7053c`.
- Fast-forwarded the local Radeq checkout to `ef7053c` on branch `new`.

Architecture impact:

- Autopilot is now physically separated from the Radeq product runtime locally.
- Radeq has a canonical local product checkout under `C:\Users\sirok\Documents\Projects\radeq`.
- Radeq default branch is now cleaned of legacy Autopilot governance files.

Verification:

- `gh repo view SirRadek/autopilot --json nameWithOwner,url,visibility,defaultBranchRef,isPrivate` confirmed `SirRadek/autopilot` exists and is private.
- `git push -u origin main` pushed the initial Autopilot control-plane commit to `SirRadek/autopilot`.
- Follow-up `gh repo view SirRadek/autopilot --json nameWithOwner,url,visibility,defaultBranchRef,isPrivate` confirmed default branch `main`.
- Autopilot root scan found only `.gitignore`, `README.md`, and `docs` at the top level.
- Autopilot runtime-file scan returned no matches for product runtime files or directories.
- Radeq cleanup branch verification passed: no legacy docs references, `git diff --check`, `npm ci`, `npm test`, and `npm run build`.
- Post-merge `gh pr view 1 --repo SirRadek/radeq` confirmed PR state `MERGED`, merge commit `ef7053c`, base `new`, and head `codex/separate-autopilot-docs`.
- Post-merge Radeq default-branch scans found no `docs/autopilot` or `docs/superpowers` tree.
- Post-merge Radeq default-branch verification passed: `npm test` passed 7 test files and 40 tests.
- Post-merge Radeq default-branch verification passed: `npm run build` built 2 Astro pages, with the existing chunk-size warning.

## Delivery System Workflow Governance

### delivery-system-phase-0-workflow-governance-2026-05-13

Mode: Autopilot control-plane documentation update
Status: completed and verified

User request:

- Proceed with the workflow modification after repository separation.

Files created:

- `docs/autopilot/delivery-system-governance.md`
- `docs/autopilot/delivery-system-ledgers.md`
- `docs/autopilot/delivery-system-model-policy.md`

Files modified:

- `docs/projects/autopilot-control-plane/work-log.md`
- `docs/autopilot/2026-05-10-autopilot-run-log.md`

Architecture impact:

- Delivery-system workflow is now formalized as phase-0 governance contracts.
- Prompt-pack baseline now reflects the post-split docs-first `SirRadek/autopilot` repository.
- Ledger impact is now a required workflow gate.
- Typed contracts, UI, and execution runtime remain deferred until explicit architecture decisions exist.

Current decision:

- Do not add `src`, `tests`, package scripts, durable workflows, connector mutation, or runtime execution in this phase.
- Use Markdown governance contracts as the source of truth for the next workflow iteration.

Verification:

- Required-term search found `Nobody approves their own work`, `decision_id`, `issue_id`, `gate_result`, `Qwen2.5`, `Autopilot monitors`, and ledger-impact gate language across the governance docs, plan, spec, architecture, and work logs.
- Placeholder-token scan returned no matches.
- Autopilot runtime-file scan returned no matches for `src`, `functions`, `migrations`, `public`, `tests`, `scripts`, `package.json`, `astro.config.mjs`, or related runtime files.
- `git diff --check` passed with only LF/CRLF normalization warnings.
