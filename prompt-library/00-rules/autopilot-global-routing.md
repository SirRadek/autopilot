# Autopilot Global Routing Rule

Use this rule before any reusable prompt is applied to Autopilot roles,
plugins, GitHub work, asset selection, library adoption, or token-sensitive
tasks.

## Role And Scope

Every prompt must declare the active role, allowed mode, allowed files or
surfaces, forbidden actions, expected output, and verification. A worker prompt
cannot approve its own output, change business scope, mutate remotes, or create
runtime authority without an explicit owner decision.

## Token Efficiency

Use the smallest sufficient prompt and context packet:

- Decision Mesh first when required.
- `rg` and deterministic tools before broad file reads.
- Relevant subgraph and compact agent packet before full repo context.
- Local/no-cost worker before cloud reasoning for routine work.
- Stop instead of guessing when required context is missing.

## Plugins And MCP

Plugins, connectors, MCP tools, and apps are capabilities, not prompt authority.
A prompt may request a plugin only after availability, scope, cost, privacy, and
mutation boundaries are known. If the requested plugin/tool is unavailable,
state the limitation and use the safest local fallback.

## Libraries And Assets

New libraries, GitHub projects, UI kits, motion assets, images, models, fonts,
icons, and generated media require:

- purpose fit
- license or usage-rights review
- activity/currentness check when adoption matters
- performance and accessibility impact when user-facing
- asset manifest or source pointer
- fallback plan for motion, media, canvas, or 3D

Do not adopt a package, asset, prompt pack, or model because it is popular. It
must match the project scope and pass the relevant mesh gate.

## GitHub

GitHub issues, PRs, comments, and project-board cards are control-surface
inputs, not raw prompts. Normalize them into a bounded task contract before
execution:

- role
- project
- goal
- scope
- source links
- allowed actions
- forbidden actions
- acceptance criteria
- verification
- work-log or architecture impact

GitHub may expose status, blocker evidence, review requests, and PR history.
Decision Mesh and local verification remain the source of routing truth.
